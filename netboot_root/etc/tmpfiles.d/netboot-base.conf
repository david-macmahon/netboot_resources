# /etc/tmpfiles.d/netboot-base.conf
#
# This file is for use in an Ubuntu-based netboot root filesystem's
# /etc/tmpfiles.d directory.
#
# Background
#
# A netboot root filessystem is typically mounted read-only, but there are
# certain subdirectories of the root filesystem that really should be
# read-write.  These directories fall into two main types: those that need to
# persist their contents between boots and those that do not.  Directories NOT
# needing persistence are replaced by symlinks that point to similarly named
# subdirectories in the tmpfs filesystem mounted at /run.  Directories that do
# need to persist are replaced by symlinks that point to similarly named
# subdirectories of /persistent, which is the mount point of a host-specific
# NFS mounted read-write filesystem.
#
# This file, `netboot-base.conf`, is intended to be placed in the
# `/etc/tmpfiles.d` directory of a netboot root filesystem for use by
# `systemd-tmpfiles` at boot time to ensure that the directories in `/run` and
# `/persistent` exist.  This file is also intended to be used by an
# administrative (e.g. manual) invocation of `systemd-tmpfiles` when setting up
# the netboot root filesystem.
#
# This configuration file primarily consists on `d` and `L+` type lines.
# During the administrative (e.g. manual) usage, the netboot root filesystem is
# read-write so the `L+` lines can take effect to create symlinks in the
# netboot root filesystem.  In this administrative mode the `d` lines will create
# subdirectories in `/run` and `/persistent` of the netboot root filesystem.
# During the boot process of a netboot client system, the `L+` lines will have
# no effect because they specified symlinks will already exist.  In this boot
# mode, the `d` lines will create the specified directories in the mounted
# `/run` filesystem and in the `/persistent` file systemdiretories` if they
# don't yet exist.
#
# On a netbooted host the `/run/` and `/persistent` directories will be mount
# points.  A `tmpfs` filesystem will be mounted on `/run`.  An NFS filesystem
# will be mounted on `/persistent`.  These mounted filesystems will hide the
# subdirectories that live under the mount points in the netboot root
# filesystem.  In a chroot environment on the netboor server (aka "head node"),
# having the underlying subdiretories will keep the symlinks from dangling
# (i.e. pointing to non-existent directories).  Even outside a chroot
# environment these subdirectories will keep the symlinks valid so long as the
# symlinks are relative rather than absolute.
#
# Usage
#
# To use this file at boot time, simply place it in the `/etc/tmpfiles.d`
# directory of the netboot root filesystem.  It will be used along with the
# other `tmpfiles.d` files in the netboot root filesystem.  When using this
# file adminsitratively (e.g. manually), be sure to give the absolute path to
# it so that the other tmpfiles.d files in the netboot root filesystem are not
# used.
#
# Using this file administratively (e.g. manually) to setup a netboot root
# environment involves modifying the netboot root filesystem on the netboot
# server (aka "head node") as if it were an actual root filesystem.  This can
# be accomplished in one of two ways:
#
# 1. Using chroot to change the apparent root directory to be the netboot root
#    filesystem.  A typical usage would look like this:
#
#        # chroot /path/to/netboot_root systemd-tmpfiles --create \
#              /etc/tmpfiles.d/netboot-base.conf
#
#    A more verbose usage would look like this:
#
#        # chroot /path/to/netboot_root env SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug \
#              systemd-tmpfiles --create /etc/tmpfiles.d/netboot-base.conf
#
# 2. Using the `--root=/path/to/netboot_root` option of `systemd-tmpfiles`.  A
#    typical usage would look like this:
#
#        # systemd-tmpfiles --root=/path/to/netboot_root --create \
#              /etc/tmpfiles.d/netboot-base.conf
#
#    A more verbose usage would look like this:
#
#        # env SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug systemd-tmpfiles \
#              --root=/path/to/netboot_root --create \
#              /etc/tmpfiles.d/netboot-base.conf
#
# Note that these two cases are similar, but differ in which `systemd-tmpfiles`
# gets invoked.  In both cases,  the `/etc/tmpfiles.d/netboot-base.conf` file
# is actually relative to `/path/to/netboot_root` so it must exist on the
# netboot server at `/path/to/netboot_root/etc/tmpfiles.d/netboot-base.conf`.
# In the first case, the `systemd-tmpfiles` of the netboot_root filesystem will
# be used, whereas in the second case the one from the netboot server will be
# used.  Which one is preferable depends on what the relative versions are, but
# generally speaking using `chroot` will likely be prefereable.
#
# Format
#
# This file follows the same format rules as a regular tmpfiles.d configuration
# file.
#
# Scope
#
# The directories listed here are those required for a base ubuntu-server
# install.  Additional packages installed by netboot_root sysadmins may also
# require similar subdirectory handling in the netboot root filesystem.  In
# those cases it is recommended to create a similar but separate file that
# follows the same formatting conventions of this file so that the
# corresponding symlinks can be managed by `netboot-make-symlinks`.
