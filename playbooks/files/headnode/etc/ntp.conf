# You do need to talk to an NTP server or two (or three).
# Use both hostname and numeric IPs for the servers.  NTP will not use
# duplicate peers if name resolves to numeric IP given here, but will (in
# theory) pick up changes to DNS records as well as use numeric IP if DNS fails
# for whatever reason.  IOW, we can get the best of both worlds!

# Note that "restrict" applies to both servers and clients, so a configuration
# that might be intended to block requests from certain clients could also end
# up blocking replies from your own upstream servers.
